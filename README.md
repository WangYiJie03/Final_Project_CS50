#### Description:
What does my final project do?
 My Project is a website that I created about a chinese artist, singer, actor, and song-producer named Jay Chou. Using HTML and CSS.The website had inlucde his introduction, lifestory, Portray, Album, and Concert.First of all. First of all, I add some codes to my index.html and style.css. And I put some images from the file Jay Chou that have several jpg and png images in the index.html and adjust the style and size for the images for example the width and the hight, and put the position to the center and etc.  The homepage shows his photo and big subtitle that says "The King of Asian Pop". There are his art collection, concert, movie that he produce and act, and TV shows he produce and act down blow. Afterward, I add some button which is my menu on the top right of my websites. Because I think that it looks very offcial and professional as a website. So I write 4 different pages about the url links that will go to my other file which are about.html,Album.html, and Concert.html, which are HOME, ABOUT , ALBUM, and concert.
What is contained in my project?
 When I just started, My first idea was to make a button at the center of the website which most of the website have. Inside Index.html,
This project(website) is to give a super nice website about Jay Chou, that his fans from all over the world can see him from a website that is only about him. I add a text-box that says "The King of Asian Pop Music" and add some quote under it. I also add an img-src after the quote. Then I have adjusted some of the stuff in style.css, such as the font, width, height, and max-width, etc. I set my background image and the background position. Afterward, I start to wondering about how to make the line under a button when you move your mouse toward the button. So I delay the time of the background iamge of the button, and I add a red little line under the button. So when you move to home, about, album, and conert. It will appears a red line under each sections. When I put my menu on the top right corner, I wrote 3 different catorgories about Jay Chou which are the Concert, movie and TV he produced and act. I put 3 different images on each categories and change the style of the color. Then, I realized I need a url to link to another page in my website. So I create 4 different html, and I put code in every html and start to coding different informations in each of them. Afterward, when I click about, I will go streat to the about.html and a web page shows the life story about Jay Chou. Also, the album and conert html will shows his album and concert.
 What was my intension? The First idea that came to my mind was to create a game, and I want to intend a game that is easy and simple to play by people. I am also a guy who enjoy to play games. I wish the game that I create can attract people and let them enjoy. but I find out that to make somebody's things in a website will be extremly cool. So I start to think about my favorite singer that I liked, and his name is called Jay Chou. Jay Chou is such an awesome guy who have great talent in music, I've listened to his song since I was about 10 years old. I enjoy the childhood memory that Jay Chou had broght to me. His song had always accompany me as I grew up until now. I really appreciate the happniess that Jay Chou brought me so I decide to create a website about him that all of his fans from all of the world can see a website just about Jay Chou.
